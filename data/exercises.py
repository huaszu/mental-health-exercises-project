When we avoid stating the truth - when we are vague or ambiguous under the guise of being kind — it is often because we are trying to lessen the discomfort for ourselves, not for the other person.",

It is a place as dangerous as it is breathtaking, a place as sought after as it is feared. The wilderness can often feel unholy because we can't control it, or what people think about our choice of whether to venture into that vastness or not. But it turns out to be the place of true belonging, and it's the bravest and most sacred place you will ever stand.",
