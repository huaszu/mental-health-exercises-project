We want the familiarity of family and the mystery that ignites our desire. We want everything, typically with the same person, for the rest of our lives. And, as we stand before our family and friends, taking part in our religious and cultural traditions, staring into each others' eyes — we vow to do it all. Promising the heavens and the earth is a recipe for mismanaged expectations. The most realistic wedding vows are the ones that acknowledge the contradictions of marriage. Anyone who's been married can tell you that, for all of the joy and love, there's just as many fights and betrayals. The question is: how will we repair and grow stronger each time? Vows are an opportunity to address this very question. And, when done well, vows can be a compass to return to every time we lose our way. This exercise is designed not just to help with wedding vow writing, but as an ongoing activity we can do throughout marriage to infuse intentionality and energy and beat back complacency.",

The resulting whiplash is exhausting, not only for the people in the relationship but the people around it. Part of why experiencing Relational Ambivalence is so challenging is because it's often a core feature of our most important relationships. How many of us hold contradictory feelings toward our own parents? Toward the sibling who never paid us back? Toward the dear, old friend who only ever talks about themself? Toward our job? Toward the place we live? Of course there are situations in which we need to definitively decide to stay or go. But there are just as many, if not more, situations in which our ability to hold our ambivalence is a sign that we understand and accept the complexities of life. As we grow, the challenge becomes — how do we know when to resolve the tension and when to hold the contradictions? It takes practice and patience. Dr. Alexandra Solomon, author of Loving Bravely, has said that patience is also a form of action. It's not purely passivity. It's not a resignation. Relational Ambivalence is a fact of life.",
